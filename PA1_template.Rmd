Loading & Preprocessing the data

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "numeric")) head(activity)

steps date interval 1 NA 2012-10-01 0 2 NA 2012-10-01 5 3 NA 2012-10-01 10 4 NA 2012-10-01 15 5 NA 2012-10-01 20 6 NA 2012-10-01 25

names(activity)

[1] "steps" "date" "interval"

library(lattice)

activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

What is the mean of total number of steps taken per day?

using 2 approaches, First approach:

StepsTotal <- aggregate(steps ~ data = akctivity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)

histogram

hist(StepsTotal$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")

mean and median

mean(StepsTotal$steps)

[1] 10766

median(StepsTotal$steps)

[1] 10765

Second approach: creating a data frame w/weekdays and total steps by day

steps <- rep(NA, 61) day <- rep("NA", 61) stepsday <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm = T) length(stepsday)

[1] 61

for (i in 1:61) { steps[i] <- stepsday[[i]] day[i] <- names(stepsday) [i] }

Then my data frame is:

df <- data.frame(day, steps) head(df)

     day steps
1 2012-10-01 0 2 2012-10-02 126 3 2012-10-03 11352 4 2012-10-04 12116 5 2012-10-05 13294 6 2012-10-06 15420

related histogram (little bit different, because of some missing data):

hist(df$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "green")

What is the average daily activity pattern?

mean of steps and time series plot

time_series <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$internal, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

related plot: mean of steps and time series

plot(row.names(time_series), time_series, type = "l", xlab = "5-min interval", ylab = "Average across all Days", main = "Average number of steps taken", col = "red")

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

max_interval <- which.max(time_series) names(max_interval)

[1] "835"

IMPUTING MISSING VALUES

activity_NA <- sum(is.na(activity)) activity_NA

[1] 2304

First NA replaced by 5-min-interval mean

StepsAverage <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean) fillNA <- numeric() for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) { obs <- activity[i, ] if (is.na(obs$steps)) { steps <- subset(StepsAverage, interval == obs$interval)$steps } else { steps <- obs$steps } fillNA <- c(fillNA, steps) }

Creating a new data set equal to the original data set including the missing values

new_activity <- activity new_activity$steps <- fillNA

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

StepsTotal2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = new_activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)

related histogram:

hist(StepsTotal2$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")

mean and median

mean(StepsTotal2$steps)

[1] 10766

median(StepsTotal2$steps)

[1] 10766

the mean is the same, the median has changed a bit.

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

day <- weekdays(activity$date) daylevel <- vector() for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) { if (day[i] == "Saturday") { daylevel[i] <- "Weekend" } else if (day[i] == "Sunday") { daylevel[i] <- "Weekend" } else { daylevel[i] <- "Weekday" } } activity$daylevel <- daylevel activity$daylevel <- factor(activity$daylevel)

stepsByDay <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + daylevel, data = activity, mean) names(stepsByDay) <- c("interval", "daylevel", "steps")

related panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = ???l???) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

xyplot(steps ~ interval | daylevel, stepsByDay, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
